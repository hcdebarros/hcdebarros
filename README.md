# 👋 Hey, I'm Helder!  

🚀 A civil engineer who traded concrete for code. Currently, I'm diving into the world of data and artificial intelligence.  

## 🛠️ Skills (or something like that)  
- 📊 Data Analysis – Turning numbers into beautiful (and hopefully useful) charts.  
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence – Teaching machines to think (or at least fake it well).  
- 💻 Python – Building smart solutions and trying not to break things.  
- 📉 Statistics – Doing magic with means and standard deviations.  
- ☁️ Sustainability – Because even technology needs to be green!
